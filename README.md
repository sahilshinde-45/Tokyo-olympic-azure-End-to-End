# Tokyo-olympic-azure-End-to-End

Overview

    This project involves designing a robust data engineering pipeline for the Tokyo Olympic Games using Azure services, including Data Lake Gen2, Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics. The pipeline facilitates seamless data integration, transformation, and analysis to generate valuable insights for the event.

Technologies Used

    Azure Data Lake Gen2: Storage solution for raw and processed data.
    Azure Data Factory: Automates and orchestrates data workflows.
    Azure Databricks: Enables advanced analytics and data transformation.
    Azure Synapse Analytics: Provides scalable data warehousing and analytical capabilities.

Project Structure

    Data Ingestion: Collects raw data from multiple sources and stores it in Data Lake Gen2.
    ETL Pipeline: Uses Azure Data Factory to process and transform data into structured datasets.
    Advanced Analytics: Performs complex data transformations and analytics within Azure Databricks.
    Data Warehousing: Leverages Synapse Analytics for efficient querying and scalable data storage.

Setup Instructions

    Azure Account: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
    Resource Deployment: Set up essential Azure servicesâ€”Data Lake Gen2, Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics.
    Configuration: Update configuration files with Azure credentials and project-specific parameters.
    Pipeline Execution: Run Data Factory pipelines for ETL, monitor Databricks jobs, and utilize Synapse Analytics for insights.
